# Ruby Chess
This is my implementation of chess in Ruby for The Odin Project. 
Enjoy my take on chess and feel free to run the repl.it

# Introduction
Hello! Welcome to my Greatest Work in progress chess game!

To play is relatively straightforward.
The general rules of chess are enforced, with the exception of en passant and castling
not being supported at the moment.

To choose a piece to move and/or a location to move to just type its coordinates
(e.x. 'd4') and then press enter

Good luck, enjoy, and my github is parkercon if there is any problems!
